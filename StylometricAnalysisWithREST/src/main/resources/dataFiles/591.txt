Very impressed so far.


Would appreciate some help on a buying a projector screen from Ireland or ebay if someone has some suggestions.

To complete will hopefully be getting a Samsung LE-F86 on condition of good reviews and hopefully better hardware than the m86 series.

Found them great to deal with, speakers have arrived in dublin and collecting on monday.

They do a deal with the avforums.com in the uk so you get a little cheaper.

This will be powered by the onkyo 605 which is impresive so far - cant wait to see what they are like with the new speaker package.

Will post results when its all hooked up - hopefully early next week.

OisinThis seperates users13:00:10 Bought a onkyo tx sr605 in the states.
Thought it would have a simple switch for 110-220v on the back like the eu models but it doesnt.
Power consumption is 6.5A so guessing ill need a 800W+ stepdown.

This is the best i could find - [url]http://www.t2retail.co.uk/productDetail.asp?Product=2737054&Submit=Find+Product[/url]

Do i have any other options?, is this stepdown necessary?

Any help appreciated - Thanks.This seperates users23:43:45 Has anyone bought a projector screen in Ireland, if so where?

Had a look at the ones in Harvey Normans and didn't like.

After finally getting round to buying a decent speaker setup im willing to splash a few few hundred on a screen(150-300).

Best deals ive seen so far are on ebay but with only feedback to go on, I am unwilling so far.

Any suggestions would be grealty appreciated.This seperates users18:15:16 Anyone bought from this crowd before?
Interested in the new samsungs

New samsungs f86 and f96 have been receiving good reviews.

40 inch f96 wont be avail in europe for a while.

40 f86 has been shipping in the uk for the last 2 weeks, and looks like the best 40 inch lcd atm. Might save you a few pennies at around 1550 euro plus 100 shipping.

Have not heard of any reviews on vartate.com but 1staudiovisual are a good online shop to deal with. [url]http://www.1staudiovisual.co.uk/catalog/samsung-le40f86bdx-inch-p-2301.html[/url]

Another TV I would consider is the Kuro PDP-4280HD.This seperates users21:45:01 Check out hdtv test for reviews

Very happy with their CS, hopefully i will be enjoying new TV by this time next week.This seperates users22:40:00 There is already a newer model of that samsung range the fe86. Improves on the hardware problems of the m86/87.

Its also alot cheaper to get TV's from sites in the UK for this model, and german ones for sony etc.

That tv is avai from sites like 1staudiovisual for 1170 + delivery (around 70). I would recommend for 1.5k 40" fe 86 have two of them and they are great. They are better than any other tv in that price bracket.This seperates users23:29:17 Maybe read what you quote?

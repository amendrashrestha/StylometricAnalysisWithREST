16:05:55 Can't wait!!! Great that you guys have it all planned out so early this year, last years one was so perfectly ran that this one should be great as well. Cyas all there :D

PS - can everyone just ignore flamers on this thread :( Happy thoughts people!This seperates users16:12:46 Just read a bit of this thread after it was linked on CS board... IMO it's a tight call and there's arguments for and against both options. I don't think it's as obvious a choice as some of the flippant comments here would suggest. Anyway.. straight copy/paste from my reply on the CS boards:


My arguments for CS:
- Last year PGR was Ireland's most successful comp by FAR. However, CS team was a LOT more competitive than both DOA & Starcraft. Is it worth sending more if they have less chance than a CS team?
- CS team played ~4-6 weeks before WCG Italy, a team this time would have 4-5 months to play? Should give better results.
- IMO CS is the most prestigious tournament. Irish team may get more coverage through this event than others. My opinion though and I'm probably being biased.

Basic reason not to choose CS:
- More teams going, possibly more opportunity for someone to do well. You would need to get real competition results and proper estimations of abilities though.

It's a tough choice and would certainly need more looking into numbers & prospects.

... suiGeneris > KaMThis seperates users09:53:14 [QUOTE='[DM]-TheDOC-']Best of luck to those who qualify. Yet again im left wanting and disappointed as Ireland maintains in its CS glory and WC3 ( one if not the biggest event at wcg) passes us by. 

Best of luck though, you will need it. I would also appreciate i the CS team that gets through this year isnt just a rehash of old players looking for a free trip, and would actually maybe try get through the group stages? Its embarassing to constantly get knocked out early and lose, and it must be hard to find sponsorship for the year after.[/QUOTE]


You're either delusional or trying to blag WC3 tourney although after reading your waffle every other WCG thread I think that would be giving you too much credit. From what you have said and what others know about WC3, you haven't even scratched the surface of the game and it's clear [B]YOU WOULD NOT EVEN COME CLOSE TO WINNING ANY GAME AT WCG[/B]. You basically remind me of any public cs clan who think because they are owning up some random public server that they must be one of the best in the world. Please remove your head from the sand / arse.

Sorry for getting offtopic... but reading this guys BS go unchallenged every time is just wrecking my head.


edit - I didn't even get to reading your post Jazzy cos I just HAD to reply to that idiot first... but glad someone thinks the same!This seperates users15:01:52 Hey bio, when is an official decision on the games being played gonna be made? CheersThis seperates users19:32:52 [QUOTE=BioHazRd]Hopefully by the end of next week - if not, then very soon after that[/QUOTE]

And just to say to Bio, please ignore the source-heads with their own agenda. They rarely deal in facts :)

... suiGeneris > KaMThis seperates users14:50:41 Loved the event last year, looking forward to this one being a great tournament as well.

We (sG) are struggling to round up a team this year unfortunately with holidays and people drifting away from CS making it hard to get a team sorted. Our 5 looks like KaM, Par, Vertakill, Longo + possibly Practical. As far as potential winners go I think this one is far more open than last year... grinded players still play cs regularly afaik, wink have a few regular CSers too and the waterford boys have been playing so I'm sure they'll all have have improved since last year.

Justice, is that source tourney on the same weekend as WCG.ie? :( Woulda been nice to see some source teams coming to WCG event as I'm sure there's some players in the new irish scene that can aim and have some brains!This seperates users16:02:42 [QUOTE=robnubis]until WCG takes on Source i dont see Ireland going pro ever[/QUOTE]

:D :D :D :D 

Make a team, kick some pro ass, get your own sponsors and travel to CGS / whatever else Valve is trying to pimp with source to make a pro team so!

Besides, the atmosphere of WCG is not particularly about going pro, more about gathering as many different nations to compete and "BE THE BEST!!!"This seperates users

Now the groom wants to have a digital version of the dvd to back it up but is short on hard drive space.

lets say the wedding dvd is 2 hours long and when ripped is split into 4 .vob files.

can anyone suggest a *free* program that will join and compress these files into one mpg/avi/mp4 file?

thanks.This seperates users10:34:33 yep, ive used that before but im looking for something that has a little more functionalityThis seperates users02:54:00 Hey,

I need to get a thread be deleted, if not the whole thread then at least last post in the thread?

I'd never seen or heard of this post, until now(5 years later!), 
and the only reason i have is because none other than my mother googled my real name,

who then rang me (in australia) to tell me that the entire world has seen this.

Whats the world coming to i ask you?

Considering that a lot of employment agencies and employers will actually google someones name these days it could cause hassle.

Whichever admin would be good enough to do this please PM me and i will send on the link for the threadThis seperates users03:49:46 Thanks for the quick reply,

The reason i posted here was because it was an archived page that was showing up in the google search.

The forum that the thread in question was posted on is no more so i wasnt sure what to do...

PM wingin its way to you RuuThis seperates users04:38:53 i agree, 

but its not me who posted it, it was something that was posted about me.This seperates users07:41:29 anyone seen it?This seperates users14:14:42 Hey,

myself and my girlfriend are in oz at the moment and have also spent a year in new zealand before hand.
before we left we took out a year insurance policy, which has long since run out as we forgot to extend our policy :rolleyes: 

problem now is that we cant seem to get travel insurance from home.
anyone know if this is every insurance company or even why this is?

and if theres no hope for getting insurance from ireland, anyone know an international company with a decent policy?

cheers!This seperates users06:27:21 i've played a bit of poker but i'm not too sure of all the hands and procedure.

can anyone recommend a game i could download so that i could play while at work without having to worry about other real players waiting for me to take my turn if i get distracted by work :)

ive seen some shareware/freeware games but they seem kinda crappy...

any suggestions?This seperates users14:53:38 memorise and repeat ad infinitum.

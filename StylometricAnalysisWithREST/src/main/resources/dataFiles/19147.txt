The ISEQ appears to be in freefall these days. You may be right but I suspect it has room to fall yet.
That extraordinary thing called sentiment is currently the driving force. It is hard to believe that crh-aib-boi deserve the drubbing they are getting but there seems no end in sight just yet.This seperates users22:09:53 bank of ireland looks like it is headed for ?10.00 shortly and crh is still going down. steer clear of the iseq. though boi at ?10 would be very tempting.This seperates users21:41:01 boi ?10.30 at close-almost beggars belief but it is still fallingThis seperates users19:16:40 These are statistics for Apple-from Yahoo Finance,today, which i think cover a similar period to one of the Rabo funds.

Is there any reason why you could not buy a dell for ?349-take it apart and stick the components into a HTPC box?This seperates users13:26:36 [url]http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/products/features.aspx/desktops[/url]

the latest dell weekly offer includes a box with windows vista basic, Intel celeron d 3.06hz, 512 ddr2 ram, 160hd and dvdrw for ?349.

if i attempted to sources these separately it would cost about ?550,This seperates users21:12:41 Adrian S you make it sound fascinating, whether I would have the patience though, I wonder.
Souper Computer, it was really just the general point I was making that buying an assembled box works out cheaper than buying the parts individually.

thanksThis seperates users22:27:12 i have an article, i would love to get published. it is a true story based on an event a long time ago, but i believe it would have some resonance for todays world.  
it would be more relevant to the independent newspaper group as it mentions reports published by the Evening Herald and the Irish Independent. Any advice on how to proceed? Would i simply email the story off to a newspaper or send a brief version of it? 
How open are newspapers to this sort of approach?This seperates users22:21:21 thanks for the replies, i will see how i get on.This seperates users21:17:01 shepthedog

not a word-good  bad or indifferent-hope springs eternalThis seperates users21:32:55 i want to boost the signal to a pc which has inbuilt wireless
can i put an aerial on to the pc?
how does it attach to the pc?This seperates users22:33:19 peanut,
thanks for the reply-its a desktop with built in wireless- i cannot see any way of attaching an aerial to it.This seperates users22:08:04 i want to install a wirreless usb into a vista machine with built in wireless. the pc accepts the driver but refuses to run the monitor software associated with the usb card. i have tried two different usb cards with the same problem.
any suggestions much appreciated.This seperates users20:49:45 i am trying to improve the signal to the vista machine by using a usb device with aerials attached. though i have the vista driver for the usb, i cannot install the rest of the software which is essential to its operation. i have disabled the onboard wireless but to no avail.This seperates users20:51:19 i am trying to access a vista pc on my netwok and though i can see it, the vista pc is seeking a password to access it. however there is no password on that pc.
anyone any suggestions to get around this.This seperates users17:29:49 Tazz T 
i am thinking of moving to Smart but they have no phone package associated with the BB. Do you use their phone service or Blueface or Skype?This seperates users19:52:43 i am on the three rock mast and i can assure you that i cannot achieve 3mb down after 8am in the morning. the latency is so bad that voip is poor and their phone line is becoming unusable. you may be lucky though since the tallaght mast is new and probably not as overcrowded as three rock.This seperates users22:40:59 tell us moreThis seperates users23:57:24 had a reasonable download of 2500 at 1.00pm today-i was quite impressed until i realized the latency was 215 the phone at that level cannot be used. why are they still advertising a phone service?This seperates users17:13:16 what phone service are Smart customers using Skype or Blueface?
Since Smart have no minute package i assume it would be too expensive to use the smart per minute system.This seperates users

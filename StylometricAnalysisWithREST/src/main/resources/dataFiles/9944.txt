Fully comp last year was 2800 with AON, Its 2300 this time round

CN quoted me 2800 for the same his year.
Dunno what TPO is... I'll find out..

Them QD B*****ds woundn't quote me.This seperates users19:24:31 Wear an Arai Astro-R meself. 2nd one i've had. Crashed with the fisrt. Head is still there, enough said.
Great fit, not too noisey. Its the buisness....:DThis seperates users03:02:29 Good news......
I'm picking up the new machine on Saturday, and i'll have a nice long spin back to dublin to get use to her.....

Should be back to normal in no time, My ankles and knee's got the worst of it.....This seperates users22:11:57 Just gor me hands on a nice set of dainese leathers. Jeez they are comfortable to wear. Fit like a glove. :) 

New Richa jacket and trousers to boot. All set to go again. :DThis seperates users22:14:11 I had the exact same thing happen to me last week mate.
Sorry to hear that..........But good that you are in one piece though.This seperates users17:24:08 Does anyone know of a place where i can get my hands on a set of dials that are in KM/H for a cbr250??

CheersThis seperates users15:09:32 Have a look on the buy and sell. There are 3 or 4 for up for sale at the minute.This seperates users17:32:49 Pinlock and Foggy mask does the job
BTW i wear glasses and dont get much bother at all.This seperates users11:06:22 Does anyone have ideas where i might be able to pick up a set of downpipes for an MC22. The ones tjat run from the manifold back to the muffler?

One of the pipes is completely corroded through just where it enters the manifold..........

Thx
Denis.This seperates users19:32:04 Been looking into getting one of these for a while too..... So yea lts us know about the weight of it........This seperates users19:31:18 Started off on a NSR125..... Nice fun bike alright......but your gonna be boared with it afer about 3-4 months.

Get something bigger that will last you longer and you can do your test on.....
Driving a CBR250RR at the minute. Great bike :) 

Insurance is gonna be more pricey on it though. Your going from the NSR which is Group 2 to Group 5. 

CN quoted me cheaper than AON for fully comp on it. Other way around for the 3rd party only strangly enough........This seperates users05:34:55 Yea i've got one of these.
Seem to be the business alright.This seperates users01:16:13 Can't really see any reason to buy a bike that small mate. You will be boared with it in no time.
There is a 50cc NSR out a city spares at the minute with a whopping 8 kilometees on the clock. The guy who bought it went for a spin roung his estate on it a was scared stiff afterwards apparently.This seperates users23:34:32 TBH you really shouldn'y bother with something that small. I started out on a NSR125. Nice bike and all that but within 3 months i was looking for something bigger......
Just something to consider.....This seperates users23:33:59 TBH you really shouldn'y bother with something that small. I started out on a NSR125. Nice bike and all that but within 3 months i was looking for something bigger......

Since the rebirth of phantom I've had the privelege of not listening to talk radio[/QUOTE]

You said it :) Love that station....

Plenty of us that drive safe....But like everything else its the bad few that get us all tared with the same brush......:mad:This seperates users21:28:43 I'm a bit of a fan of the CBR250RR's. Crackin bike :D  ....... You should be able to get something in good enough condition for 1500-2000. 

Get someone who know bikes to go with you........ Could save you a lot of headache in the future.....This seperates users21:44:09 [QUOTE=Noelie]I started on a CDR 250R MC19, it's a 91 but a cracking bike, you'd get one for about 2000 now. my first insurance was was 1350, with 0 NCB on a provisional.
It was a little big at first but you'll quickly get used to the size. High revs on it so you can really make the bike scream. still on it after 3 years and only thinking now of trading up now. so it will last you for a few years.[/QUOTE]

Yea its a hoot listening to the engine scream. Loads of pulling power from 8k up......
Damm reliable too....
Have a look on
[url]http://www.cbr250.com[/url] for more info.


and for the love of god don't pay 4000 for one....... Sounds like its from a dealer..... Go private......You will need that cash for a good lid and gear to wear.This seperates users05:41:16 [QUOTE=Noelie]only if the bike doesn't go up in flames when your sitting on it.[/QUOTE]

:D Doubtfull........
Engine in 'em is pretty tough...... Touch wood!!!This seperates users12:19:10 To be fair though that chances that bikes that old only have "9000" on the clocks id abit of a stretch.... But yea there are one's out there that are really well taken care of...... Like mine :DThis seperates users19:00:11 Can anyone recommend a good place around Dublin to get leathers repaired?

Thanks
